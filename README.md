neuroSemantics
==============

An attempt at a hybrid between adaptive artificial neural networks and semantic network AI. 

The network takes simplified language as input and creates/modifies a network based on given statements. 
Answers to queries are generated by propagating the semantic meaning of the question throug the network and 
retrieving the 'most activated' nodes. Exact methodology here is still in the works.

The network class allows for the creation of any arbitrarily connected network which can be visualized from 
a csv linkmap. Current visualization includes a force directed diagram generated using D3.
